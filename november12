###How Github Works

/home/usr/denten/project1/

logs each change that you make in a directory, allows you to see versions of directories (there is a sense of evolving versions over time)

*versions are fascinating, take for example, changing magazine covers, how each one is essentially the same, but a slightly updated version, and through studying the changing versions through time, we can learn about societal values and how they have changed.*

FS level you git init (this is where you make changes)

Stage level you git add (this is where you combine versions to make new version)

Journal level you git commit those new versions to a permanent journal, a permanent log of your changes.

**There is a remote version which multiple people can push changes to!!!!**

Commands

git status: tells us what the status of our files in git are
