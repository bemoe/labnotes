Dear Dennis,

As I mentioned in our meeting, my computer died and I still have not been able to recover any of the files.
Due to this many of my lab notes which I had taken on Markdown Pad are not saved. 
Luckily I took a few on Dillinger and saved them on the cloud, and have included these here.
Many thanks again for a wonderful class and I look forward to staying in touch!!

All best,

Ben
