Lab Notes (9.24)


At our present moment we write in a variety of formats. Plain text will allow us to level the playing field, allow to write, edit, and search across our documents.
Markdown:
   
                 # - Different levels of bold
                 * - italics
                 ** - bold
                  ` - make code block

- Markdown is a conventional language
- There are different "renderers" that give it new flavours
- *Modalities* is a fun word to italicize
